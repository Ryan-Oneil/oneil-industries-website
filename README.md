# Oneil Industries Website

The website is still a work in progress.

Currently created with Java Spring Framework. In the future the front end (HTML/CSS/JS) will be seperate and spring will run only the backend.

The website allows the ability to upload images/videos and displays them in a gallery. Users are able to register on the website and can from there upload images, sign up for discord/teamspeak services. Non registered users can see the live status of who is on Teamspeak/Discord and can view all public images including direct links to unlisted images.

# Frameworks/Libraries used:

- Spring Boot Framework
- Spring Boot Security
- Hibernate
- Aspectj
- Teamspeak3 api
